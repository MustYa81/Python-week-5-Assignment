Design my Own Class and Polymorphism Challenge
First is a base Book class with attributes title, author, and pages.
Then, there are two subclasses — Ebook and PrintedBook — to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.
In the Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge I created a base class called Animal, and subclasses Dog, Bird, and Fish.
Each one will override the move() method to describe how it moves.
